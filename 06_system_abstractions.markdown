Even popular serverless abstractions such as FaaS are not standardized across cloud providers.
SPEC-RG seeks to address this and proposes a reference architecture for FaaS {% cite van2019spec %}.
Adopting a broad view of serverless computing also invites proposals for standardized abstractions of storage and communication, which round out the core features of an operating system.
Pemberton et al. {% cite pemberton2021restless %} outline this need, whereas ServerlessOS {% cite al2018making %} offers a concrete proposal.
LegoOS {% cite shan2018legoos %} provides operating system abstractions for hardware disaggregation.
Though not positioned as serverless, it addresses the same core concerns.
