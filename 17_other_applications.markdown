Serverless computing, like cloud computing, is a general-purpose technology that can be deployed in many contexts.
Use cases that attracted attention early on included chatbots {% cite yan2016building %} and video encoding {% cite fouladi2017encoding %}.
Serverless autoscaling also makes sense for disaster response, and several such applications have been studied {% cite franz2018reunifying mejia2020serverless pawloski2019improving %}.

Serverless robotics involves motion planning and could occur in the cloud or at the edge {% cite anand2021serverless mejia2020serverless %}.
There are applications in the oil and gas industry {% cite hussain2019serverless %} and in geospatial computing {% cite bebortta2020geospatial %}.
Virtual environments, including games, are another application area {% cite donkervliet2020towards %}.
DevOps, which involves things like software testing, is a bursty workload that stands to benefit from serverless computing {% cite ivanov2018implementation %}.
There have also been proposals to use FaaS to enable blockchain applications {% cite chen2018fbaas %} and to execute FaaS on blockchain infrastructure {% cite ghaemi2020chainfaas %}.

Various scientific applications may benefit from serverless computing.
In the high-performance computing space, high invocation rates and short deadlines could challenge existing technologies, but FaaS might provide useful benefits {% cite nguyen2020motivating spillner2017faaster %}.
Other examples of scientific applications of FaaS include federated function serving {% cite chard2020funcx %}, serverless linear algebra {% cite shankar2020serverless %}, and a distributed parallel analysis engine for high-energy physics {% cite kusnierz2020distributed %}.
