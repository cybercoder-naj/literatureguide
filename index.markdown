Our aim is to include peer-reviewed publications in prominent venues, as well as other work that has attracted substantial attention.
A project of this nature is destined to be out-of-date almost the moment it is published, and we therefore encourage the community to contribute additions by submitting pull requests to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/serverlessresearch/literatureguide).
