Gabrielli et al. {% cite gabbrielli2019no %} propose the Serverless Kernel Calculus, which is similar and includes a stateful extension.
Burckhardt et al. {% cite burckhardt2021durable %} analyze durable functions in the context of a formal model, providing one demonstration of the value of these techniques.
