Network function virtualization (NFV) {% cite mijumbi2015network %} decouples network functionality from its physical embodiment in hardware.
In some ways, it is the equivalent of VMs for network equipment.
There have been multiple proposals for serverless NFV {% cite aditya2019will singhvi2020snf %}, which can be viewed as a logical evolution of NFV.
Potential applications for serverless NFV include improved quality of service for 5G networks {% cite chaudhry2020improved %}.
Work also suggests that it may be practical to combine serverless NFV and edge FaaS deployments {% cite zhang2021tapping %}.
